# Profitability Analysis Forecast: Dashboard Visualization

Exciting News! As a Data Science consultant at 10Alytics, I had the incredible opportunity to lead a project that resulted in a dynamic Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau. Let me take you through some key insights we uncovered, particularly in the realm of Profit Analysis:

## 1. Profit by Month using Trend Analysis:

Our journey began with a deep dive into monthly profits, revealing fascinating trends. In June 2015, the company faced challenges with a loss of -N8,691. Fast forward to June 2016, and the tides turned as we celebrated the highest profit ever recorded at an impressive N357,550. 

## 2. Profit by State using Map:

Geographical insights are invaluable. Lagos State emerged as the profit powerhouse, leading the charts at N393,050, closely followed by Abuja at N328,956. However, challenges were identified in Zamfara, Kebbi, Osun, and Rivers, where the company experienced losses. Understanding regional dynamics is key to strategic decision-making. 

## 3. Weekly Forecast:

The crystal ball of our dashboard allowed us to predict the future, and unfortunately, it revealed a decline in profit from July 31, 2016. The situation escalated into losses from August 14, 2016. Armed with this foresight, the company can proactively address challenges and steer the ship towards profitability. 

## 4. Weekly Forecast on Product Categories:

Diving even deeper, we dissected profit trends across three product categories—Accessories, Clothing, and Phones.

### Accessories: Brace yourselves for a sharp decrease in profit from July 31, 2016, to October 16, 2016.

### Clothing: Expect a slight dip in profit during the same period.

### Phones: The good news – a gradual increase in profit from July 31, 2016, to October 16, 2016.

# strategic business recommendations 
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Sales Performance Dashboard, here are some strategic business recommendations to enhance profitability and overall performance:

1️⃣ Optimize Product Mix:

Capitalize on the upward trend in the Phones category by allocating additional resources and marketing efforts to further boost sales.
Evaluate the Accessories category to identify the root causes of the sharp decrease in profit. Consider adjusting pricing strategies, introducing new product lines, or exploring promotional activities to revitalize this segment.
2️⃣ Regional Focus:

Leverage the knowledge gained from the Profit by State analysis. Devote extra attention and resources to markets like Lagos and Abuja, where the company is thriving.
For regions experiencing losses (Zamfara, Kebbi, Osun, and Rivers), conduct market research to understand local dynamics, consumer behavior, and competition. Tailor marketing and sales strategies accordingly.
3️⃣ Trend Analysis for Early Intervention:

Establish a robust monitoring system to detect and respond to negative trends in a timely manner. Early identification of declining profits enables proactive decision-making and course correction before losses escalate.
4️⃣ Diversification and Innovation:

Explore opportunities for product diversification or innovation, especially in categories with declining profits. Introducing new features, bundling products, or collaborating with suppliers can create fresh appeal in the market.
5️⃣ Supply Chain Optimization:

Evaluate the supply chain efficiency to reduce costs and improve overall profitability. Identify areas for streamlining processes, negotiating better terms with suppliers, or exploring alternative suppliers to enhance cost-effectiveness.
6️⃣ Customer Segmentation:

Conduct a detailed customer segmentation analysis to understand the preferences and behaviors of different customer groups. Tailor marketing messages and promotions to resonate with specific segments, maximizing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
7️⃣ Invest in Data-Driven Decision-Making:

Strengthen the company's data analytics capabilities and promote a culture of data-driven decision-making. This involves continuous training for teams, investing in advanced analytics tools, and fostering collaboration between data scientists and business units.
8️⃣ Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:

Implement a regular review and adjustment process for business strategies based on ongoing data analysis. Market conditions and consumer behaviors are dynamic, and the ability to adapt swiftly is crucial for sustained success.
By implementing these recommendations, the company can position itself strategically in the market, capitalize on strengths, and address weaknesses to achieve sustained profitability and growth.
